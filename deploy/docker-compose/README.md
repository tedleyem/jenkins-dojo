# docker-jenkins-build-projects

This repo is a list of configuration methods to deploy Jenkins
using docker, docker-compose, kubernetes, terraform, and provision Jenkins
for development/test cases.

This is also a place where I keep Jenkinsfile projects
for development purposes and projects.

Disclaimer: These are used to showcase my skills and/or help
others solve problems they are having. Not all projects and scenarios work in production based environments.
